## Project: Data Processing with Dart

Build a command line tool that can process a .csv file to generate a report as per our requirements.

### Usage

```
dart total.dart <inputFileName.csv>
```

It should then read the file and check if it exists.

> If the file name is invalid, the user will recieve a prompt 
> indicating that the give file does not exist.

After the user has entered a valid file name, generate a report giving a breakdown of all time spent on each activity type from the given data.
